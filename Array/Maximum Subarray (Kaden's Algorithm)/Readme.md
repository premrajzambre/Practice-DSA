<h1>Kadane's Algorithm</h1> 
Difficulty : Medium 
Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,-2,5}
Output:
9
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is 9
of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which 
is a contiguous subarray.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {-1,-2,-3,-4}
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is -1 
of element (-1)
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function maxSubarraySum() which takes arr and N as input parameters and returns the sum of subarray with maximum sum.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
-107 ≤ A[i] <= 107

<h1>Maximum Subarray</h1>
Difficulty : Easy

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Example 4:

Input: nums = [-1]
Output: -1
Example 5:

Input: nums = [-100000]
Output: -100000
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
 

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
